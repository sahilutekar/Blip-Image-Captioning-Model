# Blip-Image-Captioning-Model

Overview

This repository contains code for leveraging the Blip Image Captioning model developed by Salesforce. The Blip Image Captioning model combines natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques to generate descriptive captions for images.
Installation

To use the Blip Image Captioning model, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/blip-image-captioning.git

    Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the pre-trained model and processor from the Hugging Face model hub. You can find more information on how to download and use models here.

Usage
Captioning Images

You can use the Blip Image Captioning model to generate captions for images. Follow the provided example code in caption_images.py:

python

# Import necessary libraries
from PIL import Image
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration

# Load pre-trained model and processor
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

# Load image from local file system
img_path = 'path_to_your_image/demo.jpg'  # Change 'path_to_your_image' to the actual path of your image
raw_image = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')

# Conditional image captioning
text = "a photography of"
inputs = processor(raw_image, text, return_tensors="pt")

out = model.generate(**inputs)
print(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

Unconditional Image Captioning

You can also perform unconditional image captioning by omitting the text input:

python

# Unconditional image captioning
inputs = processor(raw_image, return_tensors="pt")

out = model.generate(**inputs)
print(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
